        <br>
        <br>
            <p id="About_Text"> This website is designed to help a beginner in Japanese practice the recognition of the three different alphabet's 
                characters. After learning hiragana and katakana, this quiz will allow the user to continiously drill the
                the recognition of the various characters until they are able to recall them almost instantly as if it was their
                native language. With the kanji characters, a user can practice the readings of the most common 100 kanji characters
                which will give them a decent footing in terms of kanji recognition. This test doesn't have to be a challenging "studying"
                experience, it can be more of a fun game that happens to improve your Japanese character recognition! Enjoy the website! </p>

    <h3> Will this website make me fluent????</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p id="About_Text"> The short and honest answer to this question is no, this website alone can not make you fluent in Japanese.
                The aim of this website is just to give a beginner a nice start in order to begin to be able to recognize characters
                quicker and more accurately. If you're interested in actually becoming fluent in Japanese I recommend checking out 
                <a href="https://refold.la/" target="_blank">Refold Languages</a> as well as 
                <a href="https://learnjapanese.moe/" target="_blank">The Moe Way</a> with the principles from both of these websites 
                I was able to take my Japanese to practically zero to comfortably reading light novels, manga, watching anime without 
                subs, etc. in just about a year and a half. Follow what those websites say and you will become fluent in Japanese. 
                You might not even have a use for this site after you use those sites, and that's perfectly fine! Happy studying and 
                good luck! </p>
